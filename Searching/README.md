# 🔍 Searching Algorithms in C

Welcome to the **"Searching Algorithms in C"** section of our Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This section contains fundamental search and traversal algorithms, including **Linear Search**, **Binary Search**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. These algorithms are essential tools for solving a wide variety of computational problems.

## 📘 Linear Search

### Overview

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in an array or list sequentially until the target element is found or the end is reached. It is useful for **unsorted data structures**.

### Implementation

The C implementation of Linear Search can be found in the [Linear_search.c](Linear_search.c) file. It uses a loop to iterate through the array and compare each element with the target.

## 📗 Binary Search

### Overview

Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm used to search for elements in **sorted arrays**. It repeatedly divides the search space in half and compares the target element to the middle element.

### Implementation

The C implementation of Binary Search is available in the [Binary_search.c](Binary_search.c) file. It uses a `while` loop or recursion to narrow down the search range until the target is found.

## 📘 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Overview

Breadth-First Search is a **graph traversal** algorithm that visits nodes in a level-wise manner using a **queue**. It’s particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Implementation

The BFS implementation in C is available in the `bfs.c` file. It uses an adjacency list or matrix and a queue to explore neighbors level by level.

## 📗 Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Overview

Depth-First Search is another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using **recursion** or a **stack**.

### Implementation

The C implementation of DFS is found in the `dfs.c` file. It uses either recursion or an explicit stack to traverse the graph.
