# 📚 Stack Implementation in C (DSA)

Welcome to the **Stack in C**! This project explores how to implement and use the **Stack** data structure using the C programming language.

---

## 📌 What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. The element added last is the first one to be removed.

## 🔁 Stack Operations

| Operation | Description                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `push()` | Add an element to the top of stack  |
| `pop()`  | Remove the top element              |
| `peek()` | View the top element without removing it |
| `isEmpty()` | Check if the stack is empty      |
| `isFull()`  | Check if the stack is full (for static stacks) |

## 🧱 Types of Stack Implementations in C

### 1. Stack using Arrays (Static Stack)
- Fixed size
- Easy to implement
- Less flexible

### 2. Stack using Linked List (Dynamic Stack)
- Dynamic size
- Efficient memory usage
- Slightly more complex
